INHERITANCE
Inheritance allows us to create a new class from an existing class.
  -  The new class which is created is known as subclass(child or derived class).
  -  The existing class from where the child  class is derived is called as superclass(parent class or base class).
  -  Extends keyword is used in java.
  -  It is only used when their exists an is-a relationship b/w two classes.
  -  Super keyword is used to call the method of the parent class from the method of  child class.
  -  THE MAIN IMPORTANCE OF INHERITANCE IN JAVA IS CODE REUSABILITY.
  -  WE CAN ACHIEVE POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA WITH THE HELP OF INHERITANCE.
 
 TYPES OF INHERITANCE:
 - Single inheritance
 - Multilevel inheritance
 - Hierarchical inheritance
 - Multiple inheritance
 - Hybrid inheritance




POLYMORPHISM
 - Polymorphism simply means many forms or more than one form.
 - Same entity(methods or operator or object) can perform different operations in different scenarios.
