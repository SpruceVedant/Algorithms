INHERITANCE
Inheritance allows us to create a new class from an existing class.
  -  The new class which is created is known as subclass(child or derived class).
  -  The existing class from where the child  class is derived is called as superclass(parent class or base class).
  -  Extends keyword is used in java.
  -  It is only used when their exists an is-a relationship b/w two classes.
  -  Super keyword is used to call the method of the parent class from the method of  child class.
  -  THE MAIN IMPORTANCE OF INHERITANCE IN JAVA IS CODE REUSABILITY.
  -  WE CAN ACHIEVE POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA WITH THE HELP OF INHERITANCE.
 
 TYPES OF INHERITANCE:
 - Single inheritance
 - Multilevel inheritance
 - Hierarchical inheritance
 - Multiple inheritance
 - Hybrid inheritance




POLYMORPHISM
 - Polymorphism simply means many forms or more than one form.
 - Same entity(methods or operator or object) can perform different operations in different scenarios.
 
 
 
 
 ABSTRACTION
 -  Data abstraction is a property by  virtue of which only the esssential details are displayed to the user.
 -  It is achived by interfaces and abstract classes.
 -  An abstract class is a type of class which can have abstract as well as regular methods.

 ENCAPSULATION
 -  Data encapsulation is a property of hiding data attributes and their behaviours in a single unit.
 -  It helps devs to follow modularity ehile developing software by ensureing that each object is independent of other objects
    by having its own methods , attributes
 -  It is used for the security of private properties of an object and hence serves the purpose of data hiding.
 
 
 INTERFACES
 -  In java interface specifies the behaviour of a class by providing an abstract type.
 -  Interface is a fully abstract class (methods without a body).
 -  Like abstract classes  interfaces, we cannot create objects of interfaces.
 -  Implements keyword is used to implement interfaces in java.
 -  Similar to classes interfaces can extend other interfaces.
 
 
 SUPER KEYWORD
 - Super keyword refers to super class (parent objects).
 - It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.
 - THE MOST COMMON USE OF SUPERCLASS IS TO ELIMINATE THE CONFUSION BETWEEN SUPERCLASSES AND SUBCALASSES THAT HAVE SAME METHOD NAMES.


 ENUMS
 - An enum is a special class that represents group of constants(unchangeble variables ,like final variable)
 - Enum keyword is used to create enums.
