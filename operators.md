BITWISE OR ( | )
This operator is a binary operator, denoted by ‘|’. It returns bit by bit OR of input values, i.e., if either of the bits is 1, it gives 1, else it shows 0. 
a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)

Bitwise OR Operation of 5 and 7
  0101
| 0111
 ________
  0111  = 7 (In decimal) 





BITWISE AND ( & )
This operator is a binary operator, denoted by ‘&.’ It returns bit by bit AND of input values, i.e., if both bits are 1, it gives 1, else it shows 0. 
a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)

Bitwise AND Operation of 5 and 7
  0101
& 0111
 ________
  0101  = 5 (In decimal) 







BITWISE XOR ( ^ )
This operator is a binary operator, denoted by ‘^.’ It returns bit by bit XOR of input values, i.e., if corresponding bits are different, it gives 1, else it shows 0. 
a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)

Bitwise XOR Operation of 5 and 7
  0101
^ 0111
 ________
  0010  = 2 (In decimal) 





Bitwise Complement (~)
This operator is a unary operator, denoted by ‘~.’ It returns the one’s complement representation of the input value, i.e., with all bits inverted, which means it makes every 0 to 1, and every 1 to 0. 
a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)

Bitwise Complement Operation of 5

~ 0101
 ________
  1010  = 10 (In decimal) 
Note: Compiler will give 2’s complement of that number, i.e., 2’s complement of 10 will be -6.





TREE TRAVERSALS

Depth First Traversals: 
(a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3 
(b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) : 1 2 4 5 3 
(c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1
Breadth-First or Level Order Traversal: 1 2 3 4 5
